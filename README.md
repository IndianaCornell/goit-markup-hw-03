### 🎨 Styling

- **«B1»** Global style reset is allowed using tag selectors for elements like `<h1>`...`<h6>`, `<p>`, and `<ul>`.
- **«B2»** Elements have no margins that "break through" their parent containers.
- **«B3»** In horizontal (one-line) element collections, any left or right margin is removed from the first/last item to avoid layout issues.
- **«B4»** The `margin` property is used only for spacing between adjacent elements.
- **«B5»** The `padding` property is used to create space between the content and the edge of the parent.
- **«B6»** All `margin` and `padding` values match those in the layout exactly.
- **«B7»** A universal helper class `.container` is used to center and constrain content width.
- **«B8»** The width of `.container` is **1158px**, as defined in the layout.
- **«B9»** `.container` wraps the content of the header, footer, and main sections.
- **«B10»** Flexbox is applied only where appropriate — such as in headers, navigations, and horizontal lists — not everywhere.
- **«B11»** Final element sizes in the browser match the layout precisely.
- **«B12»** Elements do **not** have fixed height — their height is determined by the content inside.
- **«B13»** The header has a subtle bottom border that’s barely visible on close zoom.
- **«B14»** Sections are stacked like books — without external margins between them.
- **«B15»** Each section has the class `.section` with `padding-top` and `padding-bottom` set to **120px**.
- **«B16»** Grids are implemented using the method from the lecture notes and video workshop.
- **«B17»** Portfolio page cards have a **bottom-only** border using the `border` property.
